    "In this exercise, we look at the titanic dataset, which is on Moodle in the file \"titanic_survival_data.csv\". \n",

    "Answer the following questions:\n",
    "1. Load in the dataset, replace the missing values in the age column by the mean age of the column, and encode the Sex column as 0 and 1s.\n",
    "2. Make an X set of the variables \"Pclass\", \"Sex\", \"Age\" and \"SibSp\", and take Survived as the y variable. Then make train-test split with 20% of the dataset for testing.\n",
    "3. Do MinMax scaling on the training dataset.\n",
    "5. Use 10-fold cross-validation on the training set to train different KNN algorithms and chose a suitable K based on accuracy score.\n",
    "6. For the chosen K, train a model on the entire training dataset.\n",
    "7. Create a confusion matrix for the model trained in 4 and calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score on the test dataset.\n",
    "8. OPTIONAL: Create a ROC curve for the test dataset as well as the AUC score\n",
    "9. OPTIONAL: Can you use 10-fold cross validation to get an estimate of the recall instead of accuracy?"

    "5. Train a logistic regression classifier to predict the variable `income` based on the feature variables selected in 2 and compare it to the KNN classifier.\n",
    "6. Train a decision tree classifier to predict the variable `income` based on the feature variables selected in 2 and compare it to the previous classifiers.\n",
    "7. Train a random forest classifier to predict the variable `income` based on the feature variables selected in 2 and compare it to the previous classifiers.\n",
    "8. Train a AdaBoost classifier to predict the variable `income` based on the feature variables selected in 2 and compare it to the previous classifiers."
